// Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

// How it works
// User selects a sorting algorithm from a dropdown
// Once option is selected, store user input in a variable
// Display a randomly generated list of lines with varying length betweeen 10px and 100px
// Allow the user to start/stop the sorting by clicking a button
// When the sorting starts, allow the user to stop it if necessary before it concludes
// Allow the user to reset the pattern or generate a new pattern of starter data to sort
// When algorithm runs, move lines left/right based on the sorting algorithm logic

// MVP Flow (Bubble Sort only)
// Create the random sample of lines to sort
// Move the lines around on the screen
// Demonstrate the sorting happening on the screen using animations/transitions
// Indicate to the user when the sorting starts/ends
